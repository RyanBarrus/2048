### This is a basic version of the game 2048 made in R.
The inspiration for this came from a coding challenge on the website Codesignal. The challenge provides you with the initial gameboard and several moves, it requires you to return the status of the gameboard after those moves. After solving the challenge, I decided to finish creating the game.
